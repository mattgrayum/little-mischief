                    Get ready for Little Mischief - a soul-stirring, funk-fueled powerhouse from sunny
                    California! This explosive fusion of rock, soul, funk, and Americana is fronted
                    by the dynamic Michael Baker Jr. (Vocals/Guitar/Songwriter) and backed by the
                    magnetic Zach Frese (Bass/Vocals), the pulsating Ben Parker (Drums), the rhythmic
                    Matthew Grayum (Percussion), and the groove-machine Sam Kulchin (Guitar and Vocals)
                    bringing the heat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Little Mischief isn't just about music; they're a sonic explosion, igniting dance
                    floors and transforming every beat into a legendary experience. Their chemistry,
                    honed over countless nights of campfire jams and smokey studio sessions, delivers
                    a sound that's as infectious as it is soulful. Expect to jump, dance, and even
                    headbang as they weave their diverse set list into an unforgettable experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Little Mischief takes the stage, their music isn't just something you hear -
                    it's something you live and breathe. Dive into the groove and experience a Little
                    Mischief.
